Routing protocols require periodically flooding the entire system with the updated state of the network. Routing protocols define the rules and semantics of how this information is spread throughout the network and can be classified into proactive and reactive protocols, both of which eventually sends out control packets to the network.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/deep-learning-assisted-cross-layer-routing-in-multi-hop-wireless-network/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/low-cost-wireless-testbed-for-internet-of-things-ad-hoc-networks-prototyping-and-evaluation/>Low Cost Wireless Testbed for Internet of Things Ad Hoc Networks Prototyping and Evaluation</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-06-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract There is a distinct gap in IoT research between simulation and implementation of new networking protocols. While simulations allow fast validation of new ideas, it is not until implemented into a real system that a novel protocol gains tracking. We build an ad hoc network system to enable energy-aware protocol testing in real devices with reusable code. We demonstrate how to use low-cost components with open-source libraries to implement the system.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/low-cost-wireless-testbed-for-internet-of-things-ad-hoc-networks-prototyping-and-evaluation/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/optimal-uav-positioning-for-a-temporary-network-using-an-iterative-genetic-algorithm/>Optimal Uav Positioning for a Temporary Network Using an Iterative Genetic Algorithm</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-05-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract Efficient arrangement of UAVs in a swarm formation is essential to the functioning of the swarm as a temporary communication network. Such a network could assist in search and rescue efforts by providing first responders with a means of communication. We propose a user-friendly and effective system for calculating and visualizing an optimal layout of UAVs. An initial calculation to gather parameter information is followed by the proposed algorithm that generates an optimal solution.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/optimal-uav-positioning-for-a-temporary-network-using-an-iterative-genetic-algorithm/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/area-optimized-uav-swarm-network-for-search-and-rescue-operations/>Area Optimized Uav Swarm Network for Search and Rescue Operations</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-01-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract Intelligent robot swarms are increasingly being explored as tools for search and rescue missions. Efficient path planning and robust communication networks are critical elements of completing missions. The focus of this research is to give unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the ability to self-organize a mesh network that is optimized for area coverage. The UAVs will be able to read the communication strength between themselves and all the UAVs it is connected to using RSSI.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/area-optimized-uav-swarm-network-for-search-and-rescue-operations/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/search-and-rescue-operations-with-mesh-networked-robots/>Search and Rescue Operations With Mesh Networked Robots</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2018-11-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract Efficient path planning and communication of multi-robot systems in the case of a search and rescue operation is a critical issue facing robotics disaster relief efforts. Ensuring all the nodes of a specialized robotic search team are within range, while also covering as much area as possible to guarantee efficient response time, is the goal of this paper. We propose a specialized search-and-rescue model based on a mesh network topology of aerial and ground robots.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/search-and-rescue-operations-with-mesh-networked-robots/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=/categories/conference/page/2/><span class=button__text>Older posts</span>
