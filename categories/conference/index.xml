&lt;p>Wireless ad hoc networks rely on exchanging information among the nodes to find a feasible route between source and destination. Routing protocols require periodically flooding the entire system with the updated state of the network. Routing protocols define the rules and semantics of how this information is spread throughout the network and can be classified into proactive and reactive protocols, both of which eventually sends out control packets to the network. However, with the increase of the scale of the network, the amount of packets exchanged uses resources that could be otherwise used for application messages. In this paper, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to restrict the flooding radius of control packets. We define the problem objective as a regression problem and use neural networks to model it. The model can be used in networks that share similar attributes, suggesting that transfer learning can be used to re-purpose the initial model. The results show that using machine learning reduces the amount of resources used to maintain the network state up to date, which could be subsequently used to improve the overall performance of the networked system. We anticipate machine learning to be the starting point for more sophisticated models of cross-layer routing mechanisms.&lt;/p>

We build an ad hoc network system to enable energy-aware protocol testing in real devices with reusable code.

&lt;p>Efficient arrangement of UAVs in a swarm formation is essential to the functioning of the swarm as a temporary communication network. Such a network could assist in search and rescue efforts by providing first responders with a means of communication. We propose a user-friendly and effective system for calculating and visualizing an optimal layout of UAVs. An initial calculation to gather parameter information is followed by the proposed algorithm that generates an optimal solution. A visualization is displayed in an easy-to-comprehend manner after the proposed iterative genetic algorithm finds an optimal solution. The proposed system runs iteratively, adding UAV at each intermediate conclusion, until a solution is found. Information is passed between runs of the iterative genetic algorithm to reduce runtime and complexity. The results from testing show that the proposed algorithm yields optimal solutions more frequently than the k-means clustering algorithm. This system finds an optimal solution 80% of the time while k-means clustering is unable to find a solution when presented with a complex problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Intelligent robot swarms are increasingly being explored as tools for search and rescue missions. Efficient path planning and robust communication networks are critical elements of completing missions. The focus of this research is to give unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the ability to self-organize a mesh network that is optimized for area coverage. The UAVs will be able to read the communication strength between themselves and all the UAVs it is connected to using RSSI. The UAVs should be able to adjust their positioning closer to other UAVs if RSSI is below a threshold, and they should also maintain communication as a group if they move together along a search path. Our approach was to use Genetic Algorithms in a simulated environment to achieve multi-node exploration with emphasis on connectivity and swarm spread.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Efficient path planning and communication of multi-robot systems in the case of a search and rescue operation is a critical issue facing robotics disaster relief efforts. Ensuring all the nodes of a specialized robotic search team are within range, while also covering as much area as possible to guarantee efficient response time, is the goal of this paper. We propose a specialized search-and-rescue model based on a mesh network topology of aerial and ground robots. The proposed model is based on several methods. First, each robot determines its position relative to other robots within the system, using RSSI. Packets are then communicated to other robots in the system detailing important information regarding robot system status, status of the mission, and identification number. The results demonstrate the ability to determine multi-robot navigation with RSSI, allowing low computation costs and increased search-and-rescue time efficiency.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>UAV networks are envisioned to play a crucial role in the future generations of wireless networks. The mechanical degrees of freedom in the movement of UAVs provides various advantages for tactical and civilian applications. Due to the high cost of failures in system-based tests, initial analysis and refinement of designs and algorithms for UAV applications are performed through rigorous simulations. Current trend of UAV specific simulators is mainly biased towards the mechanical properties of flying. For network-centric simulations, the intended measurements on the performance of protocols in mobile scenarios are conventionally captured from general-purpose network simulators, which are not natively equipped with comprehensive models for 3D movements of UAVs. To facilitate such simulations for UAV systems, this paper presents different mobility models for emulation of the movement of a UAV. Detailed description of three mobility models (random walk, random direction, and Gauss-Markov) are presented, and their associated movement patterns are characterized. This characterization is further extended by considering the effect of large obstacles on movement patterns of nodes following the three models. The mobility models are prepared as open-source add-ons for ns-3 network simulator.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a multihop ad hoc network, end-to-end data transmissions traverse through multiple inter-node wireless links. A jammer can disrupt the entire data transfer of a network by intentionally interfering with links between a subset of nodes. The impact of such attacks is escalated when the jammer is moving. While the majority of current ad hoc protocols consider omnidirectional transmission and reception, adaptive antennas can be utilized for spatial filtering of the jamming signal. This paper investigates the performance of employing adaptive beam nulling as a mitigation technique against jamming attacks in multihop ad hoc networks. Considering a moving jammer, the survivability of links and connectivity in such networks are studied by simulating various node distributions and different mobility patterns of the attacker. In addition, the impact of errors in estimation of direction of arrival and beamforming on the overall network performance are also examined. The results indicate a significant improvement in retaining connectivity under jamming when adaptive beam nulling is applied.&lt;/p>
