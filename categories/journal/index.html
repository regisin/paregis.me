Each UAV covers a circular area, called a hotspot cell, and serves the users in it. Natural disasters can cause unpredictable mobility of users, randomly overloading some cells, called hot zones, for different time intervals. Along with an efficient initial deployment, this paper presents a two-fold approach to handle hot zones. First, the loads in overlapped sections are redistributed to neighbors.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/dynamic-self-reconfiguration-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-to-serve-overloaded-hotspot-cells/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/distributed-allocation-and-dynamic-reassignment-of-channels-in-uav-networks-for-wireless-coverage/>Distributed Allocation and Dynamic Reassignment of Channels in Uav Networks for Wireless Coverage</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2019-03-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract Providing wireless coverage to users using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) encounters two major challenges: deployment and channel allocation. To this end, solutions to both issues are proposed in this paper. An overloaded UAV attempts to acquire more channels by performing channel bonding/aggregation followed by requesting its chosen peers to move closer for load sharing. The proposed channel reallocation schemes minimize interference caused by channel reassignments, or change in network topology.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/distributed-allocation-and-dynamic-reassignment-of-channels-in-uav-networks-for-wireless-coverage/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/distributed-adaptive-beam-nulling-to-survive-against-jamming-in-3-d-uav-mesh-networks/>Distributed Adaptive Beam Nulling to Survive Against Jamming in 3 D Uav Mesh Networks</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2018-06-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract In the future generation mission-centric tactical network, 3D UAV mesh network will play a crucial role for its several advantages. However, any adversarial node with the 3D movement capability poses a significant threat to these networks as the adversary can position itself to attack the crucial links. An adaptive beamnulling antenna is used to spatially filter out signal coming from a certain direction that can maintain the links active without requiring additional spectrum.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/distributed-adaptive-beam-nulling-to-survive-against-jamming-in-3-d-uav-mesh-networks/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/multi-hop-mobile-wireless-mesh-network-testbed-development-and-measurements/>Multi Hop Mobile Wireless Mesh Network Testbed Development and Measurements</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2017-08-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract Mesh networks are envisioned to play a major role in the future of Smart-Cities and Internet of Things technologies, and can be a great ally in executing mission-centric tasks like search and rescue, and assist first responders. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of development of a mobile mesh network testbed with the help of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and perform measurement tests in an indoor environment. We used open-source software to enable the testbed, such as Linux as the operating system, and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to enable the wireless mesh network.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/multi-hop-mobile-wireless-mesh-network-testbed-development-and-measurements/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/publications/adaptive-beam-nulling-in-multihop-ad-hoc-networks-against-a-jammer-in-motion/>Adaptive Beam Nulling in Multihop Ad Hoc Networks Against a Jammer in Motion</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2016-11-01</span></div><div class=post-content>Abstract In multihop ad hoc networks, a jammer can drastically disrupt the flow of information by intentionally interfering with links between a subset of nodes. The impact of such attacks can escalate when the jammer is moving. As a countermeasure for such attacks, adaptive beam-forming techniques can be employed for spatial filtering of the jamming signal. This paper investigates the performance of adaptive beam nulling as a mitigation technique against jamming attacks in multihop ad hoc networks.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/publications/adaptive-beam-nulling-in-multihop-ad-hoc-networks-against-a-jammer-in-motion/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>All rights preserved.</span></div></div></footer><script src=/assets/main.js></script>
