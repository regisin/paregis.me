## Abstract
Efficient path planning and communication of multi-robot systems in the case of a search and rescue operation is a critical issue facing robotics disaster relief efforts. Ensuring all the nodes of a specialized robotic search team are within range, while also covering as much area as possible to guarantee efficient response time, is the goal of this paper. We propose a specialized search-and-rescue model based on a mesh network topology of aerial and ground robots. The proposed model is based on several methods. First, each robot determines its position relative to other robots within the system, using RSSI. Packets are then communicated to other robots in the system detailing important information regarding robot system status, status of the mission, and identification number. The results demonstrate the ability to determine multi-robot navigation with RSSI, allowing low computation costs and increased search-and-rescue time efficiency.
