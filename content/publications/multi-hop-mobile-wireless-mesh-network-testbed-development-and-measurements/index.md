## Abstract
Mesh networks are envisioned to play a major role in the future of Smart-Cities and Internet of Things technologies, and can be a great ally in executing mission-centric tasks like search and rescue, and assist first responders. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of development of a mobile mesh network testbed with the help of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and perform measurement tests in an indoor environment. We used open-source software to enable the testbed, such as Linux as the operating system, and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to enable the wireless mesh network. The physical components include open-source hardware like Raspberry Pi computers, and mobility is enabled through the use of a mobile robot Pioneer 3. We evaluate the network in various scenarios, first establishing benchmark measurement in a stationary setup, and then comparing with a mobile variation.
