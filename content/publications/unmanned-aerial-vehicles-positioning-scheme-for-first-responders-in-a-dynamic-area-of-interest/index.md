## Abstract
In this paper, we explore the problem of finding the initial positions to deploy UAVs to provide service to ground personnel. In this work, we propose a greedy algorithm that finds a feasible solution that guarantees 100% coverage on any given map. We defined subareas of the map which do not need coverage as excluding zones. We considered both excluding zones and the connectivity constraints in the algorithm. By avoiding these zones and keeping all nodes connected to the network we can reduce the total number of UAVs needed to provide coverage without losing the communication capability. We show that the complexity of the algorithm is linear with respect to the input parameters. Simulation results show the behavior of our approach with different maps. We observe a convergence on the number of nodes needed when varying the input map.
