## Abstract
Providing wireless coverage to users using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) encounters two major challenges: deployment and channel allocation. To this end, solutions to both issues are proposed in this paper. An overloaded UAV attempts to acquire more channels by performing channel bonding/aggregation followed by requesting its chosen peers to move closer for load sharing. The proposed channel reallocation schemes minimize interference caused by channel reassignments, or change in network topology. The simulation results show that when employing these schemes, more data is served with reduced discontinuous service time and efficient usage of limited battery power.
