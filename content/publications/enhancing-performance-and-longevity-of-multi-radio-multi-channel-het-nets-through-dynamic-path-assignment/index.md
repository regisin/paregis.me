## Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel approach to assign paths to data streams in a mission-centric heterogeneous wireless mesh network where nodes have multi-channel radio interfaces. Different than conventional packet-switching routing, our approach assigns the paths using a link utility based on sub-topologies of non-orthogonal frequencies. We use a graph coloring algorithm to calculate the utility of each link. We then propose two path assignment strategies: (i) single path, where each data stream traverse a unique path, and (ii) split-path, where the flows can be divided into multiple paths. Results show no best strategy fits all scenarios. Instead, in different situations, different algorithms are better suited.
